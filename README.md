# Chicago-Criminal-Case-Analysis
This is a Database Engineering project with Excel, Python, MySQL, and Tableau. Our team retrieved the data from Kaggle, normalized it on Excel and Python, then loaded onto MySQL server for analysis. Eventually, the server is connected to Tableau to create interactive dashboard for key stakeholders.
